To run the program run on the terminal the following commands - 
g++ -g assembler.cpp
./a.out

Important Points - 
1. A file named "input.txt" with the input assembly code must be in the same directory as the assembler.cpp source code.
2. I have provided one sample "input.txt" file which is the same as mentioned in the textbook.
3. Comments have . symbol in the label field of the input file.
4. There should be no spaces before and after ',' while using indirect addressing.
5. Three files "intermediate.txt", "listing.txt" and "output.txt" will be generated at the end of the execution. 
6. "output.txt" file contains the final output (machine code).
7. I have written comments to explain the various parts of the code for better understanding of the program.
